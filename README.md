# Strongholdr

A C developed program to automate the stronghold building rules found in the D&D 3.5e supplement "Stronghold Builder's Guidebook".

# Usage

This program does not specifically draw out or visualize the stronghold in any way, this is simply just a program to automate the cost calculation that the above mentioned rulebook has in droves. For a visual stronghold/map maker, I would recommend dungeondraft, which you can find [here](https://dungeondraft.net/).

## Project status
Currently working on this in my spare time for fun.  I am hoping to eventually add a UI so creating a stronghold doesn't require memorizing commands.
